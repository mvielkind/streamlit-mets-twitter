                "To keep up with the tweets being received I separated reading the stream and processing the tweets into "
                "separate processes. When the stream is read each tweet is written to an Elastic index. A process was "
                "scheduled every minute to retrieve new documents from the database. The NLP models process the new "
                "documents in a batch and their entries updated. The entire process results in less than 2 minutes of "
                "latency between when the tweet is received and when it's represented in the dashboard. And it all runs on "
